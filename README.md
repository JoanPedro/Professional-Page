## Getting Started
You will need a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with access to the command-line and permission to install new system packages. An active internet connection is required in order to install the following required software:

* Node https://nodejs.org/en/
* NPM https://www.npmjs.com/
* Yarn https://yarnpkg.com/
* Vue CLI https://cli.vuejs.org/

Using the terminal, navigate to the folder containing the unzipped theme and run the `yarn` command. This will install all of the required packages and prepare your project for local development and production deployment. Once complete, type `yarn serve` and press the <kbd>enter</kbd> key. Vue CLI will then compile the project and serve a local server located at http://localhost:8080.
